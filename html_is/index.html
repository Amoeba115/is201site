    <h2>This thing looks freaking rad. Here's why:</h2>
    <ul class="centeredlist">
        <li class="emphasizetext">It's like an ocean, and water is pretty chill. Water is my day one homie fr</li>
        <li>The water is actually made of stars and cosmic-looking stuff, which is equally dope</li>
        <li>It's all vibrant and luminescent and whatnot</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Here's a list of the coolest things about it in order:</h2>
    <ol class="centeredlist">
        <li>Those little green sparks on the crest of the wave</li>
        <li>The seemingly infinite stretch of cosmos above it, inspiring curiosity and creativity</li>
        <li class="emphasizetext">That planet overhead. Can it sustain life? Could it ever? Does anyone live there? Are they friendly? Who knows???</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Like seriously this pic goes so hard (feel free to screenshot)</p>
